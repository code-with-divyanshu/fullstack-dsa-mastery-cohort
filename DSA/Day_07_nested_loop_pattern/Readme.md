# **Day 7 - Nested Loops & Pattern Programming**

This repository contains JavaScript solutions for **nested loops and pattern programming** problems, covering **triangular patterns, number sequences, and character-based patterns**. The last pattern problem is assigned as an **assignment**.

---

## **📌 Summary**

In this session, I focused on **nested loops** and their usage in **pattern programming**. This included:

✅ **Star Patterns:** Printing different triangle formations  
✅ **Number Patterns:** Creating sequences within loops  
✅ **Alphabet Patterns:** Generating character-based designs  
✅ **Nested Loops & Logic:** Improving control flow for complex patterns

These exercises helped strengthen my **looping concepts** and problem-solving abilities.

## **📂 Questions and Explanations**

### **1️⃣ Nested Loop - Square Star Pattern**

A basic nested loop prints a **5x5 square of stars (`*`)**.

### **2️⃣ Right-Angled Triangle (Star Pattern)**

Prints a **right-angled triangle** using stars (`*`).  
✅ **Example for `n = 5`:**

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

### **3️⃣ Right-Angled Triangle (Number Pattern)**

Prints a **number triangle** where each row contains numbers from `1` to `row index`.  
✅ **Example for `n = 5`:**

```
1
12
123
1234
12345
```

### **4️⃣ Inverted Right-Angle Triangle (Star Pattern)**

Prints a **reverse right-angled triangle** using stars.  
✅ **Example for `n = 5`:**

```
* * * * *
* * * *
* * *
* *
*
```

## **📌 Assignment - Right Angle Triangle (Alphabet Pattern)**

This is an **assignment** where a **triangle is printed using alphabets (`A-Z`)** instead of numbers or stars.  
✅ **Example for `n = 5`:**

```
A
A B
A B C
A B C D
A B C D E
```

### **How to Solve?**

🔹 Use nested loops  
🔹 Convert loop indices into ASCII characters using `String.fromCharCode()`  
🔹 Print each row with increasing alphabets

## **🚀 What I Learned?**

🔹 Improved my **understanding of nested loops**  
🔹 Practiced **pattern programming & character manipulation**  
🔹 Developed a better approach to **iterative logic building**

Looking forward to more **complex patterns and logical problem-solving!** 🚀
