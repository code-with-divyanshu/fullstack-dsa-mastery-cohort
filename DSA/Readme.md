# **DSA Repository**

This repository is dedicated to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice**, including **daily classwork, assignments, and problem-solving exercises**.

## **📌 Structure**

- **Daily Classwork**: Concepts covered in class with **explanations and implementations**.
- **Assignments**: Problems and solutions assigned for **self-practice**.
- **Pattern Programming**: Various **star, number, and character patterns** for loop mastery.
- **Topic-wise Segmentation**: Organized by topics such as **Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Sorting, Searching, and Dynamic Programming**.

## **🚀 Goals**

- Strengthen **problem-solving skills** for technical interviews.
- Improve **coding efficiency and logical thinking**.
- Master **JavaScript for DSA** through structured learning.
