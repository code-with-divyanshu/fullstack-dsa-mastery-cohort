# 🔏 Authentication With JWT & Token

This project demonstrates the core concepts of user authentication and the use of tokens for secure, stateless API access in a Node.js/Express application.

## 🔒 What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. In web development, this typically means ensuring that a user logging in is really who they say they are—usually by checking credentials like a username and password.

## 🔑 What is a Token?

A token is a piece of data that is generated by the server after successful authentication. It acts as a temporary, digital "key" that the client can use to prove their identity during subsequent requests, instead of re-sending a password each time.

Tokens are a core part of stateless authentication, such as when using JWT (JSON Web Token).
