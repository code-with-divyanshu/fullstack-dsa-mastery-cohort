# 🔏 Authentication With JWT & Token

This project demonstrates the core concepts of user authentication and the use of tokens for secure, stateless API access in a Node.js/Express application.

## 🔒 What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. In web development, this typically means ensuring that a user logging in is really who they say they are—usually by checking credentials like a username and password.

## 🔑 What is a Token?

A token is a piece of data that is generated by the server after successful authentication. It acts as a temporary, digital "key" that the client can use to prove their identity during subsequent requests, instead of re-sending a password each time.

Tokens are a core part of stateless authentication, such as when using JWT (JSON Web Token).

Absolutely! Here’s a professional, concise README.md template for your authentication system (register, login, user, logout) in Node.js/Express with JWT and cookies, suitable for the directory containing those four routes:

# 🔐 Authentication API (Register, Login, User, Logout)

This project demonstrates a complete authentication workflow using Node.js, Express, JWT (JSON Web Token), cookies, and MongoDB. It covers user registration, login, a protected user route, and logout, providing a foundation for secure, stateless authentication.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Registration** – Register new users and securely issue a JWT.
- **User Login** – Authenticate users and send a JWT in a secure HTTP-only cookie.
- **Protected Route** – Access user information only if a valid authentication token (JWT) is present.
- **Logout** – End authenticated sessions by clearing the JWT cookie.
- **Cookie-based Authentication** – Secure, stateless session flow.
- **Simple, Clear API Structure** – Easy to extend and integrate into full-stack applications.

## 📖 Routes Overview

### 1. Register

`POST /register`

- Registers a new user with username and password.
- Checks for existing usernames (no duplicates).
- Returns a JWT cookie on successful registration.

### 2. Login

`POST /login`

- Authenticates user with username and password.
- Returns a JWT cookie on successful login.

### 3. User (Protected)

`GET /user`

- Requires a valid JWT token in cookies.
- Returns user details (excluding password).

### 4. Logout

`GET /logout`

- Clears the authentication cookie.
- Effectively logs the user out.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

1. **Clone this repo and navigate to the project:**

   ```bash
   git clone
   cd path/to/your/auth-folder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file and set:
     ```
     JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
     ```

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
    node server.js
   # or
   npx  nodemon server.js
   ```

5. **Test the API using Postman or curl:**
   - Register, login, fetch `/user`, and logout!

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Passwords are stored in plaintext** in this sample for learning. For real applications, always store hashed passwords (using bcrypt).
- **JWT_SECRET** must be kept secure and out of version control.
- Cookies are set to last 7 days, HTTP-only.
