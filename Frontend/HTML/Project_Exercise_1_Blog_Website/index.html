        <h2>My First Blog Post:- The Story of Hanuman</h2>
        <p>
          The Ramayana is one of the most important epic stories from ancient
          India. It tells the tale of Rama, a legendary prince who must rescue
          his wife, Sita, who is kidnapped by the demon King Ravana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hanuman is a Hindu god whose shape is half-monkey, half-human. He is
          the most devoted follower of Prince Rama, so he features a lot in the
          Ramayana as well as lots of other traditional Hindu stories and
          artworks. Hanuman has special powers and qualities that he uses to
          help Rama rescue his wife Sita. Because Hanuman uses his powers in the
          service of others he has come to symbolise the perfect Hindu who has
          lots of special qualities but is not selfish with them, and uses his
          abilities to help people.
